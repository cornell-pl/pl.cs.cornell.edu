This is a 1-credit seminar that meets every week to discuss classic papers in
programming languages adjacent fields.
Great works is a discussion-focused reading group. We expect participants to
read the papers and attend the seminar.

#### Reading Protocol
Presenters should work with the organizers to figure out which parts of the paper
they will focus on.
The confirmation for reading with any additional materials goes out a week before
on the PLDG mailing list:

      pldg-l@cornell.edu

To join, send a message to [pldg-l-request@cornell.edu][join-pldg] with the
subject "join" and a blank body.

#### Presenting Papers

The expectation is that people have read the papers.
The focus should be discussions and not a full presentation of all the topics
in the papers.
Aim for 25-30 minutes and try to weave in discussion questions throughout
your presentation.

#### Getting Papers

Paper titles are hyperlinked to PDFs available on the web. If a link is broken,
open an issue at [the Github repo for this
website](https://github.com/cornell-pl/pl.cs.cornell.edu/issues), or find
a working link and make a pull request.
