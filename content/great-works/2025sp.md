This is a seminar that meets every week to discuss classic papers in
programming languages adjacent fields.
Great works is a discussion-focused reading group. We expect participants to
read the papers and attend the seminar.

#### Reading Protocol
Our primary means of communication is through slack: [Cornell CIS #great-pl](https://cornellcis.slack.com/archives/CFKJZV78R)
Please also join the PLDG mailing list:

      pldg-l@cornell.edu

To join, send a message to [pldg-l-request@cornell.edu][join-pldg] with the
subject "join" and a blank body.

#### Presenting Papers

This seminar has two parts --- a presentation that familiarize people with the
topic and help them with paper reading, and a discussion in the subsequent week
with the expectation that people have a good understanding of the paper. Aim
for 20-25 minutes for your presentation, and 25-30 minutes discussion (prepare
questions and slides).

#### Getting Papers
